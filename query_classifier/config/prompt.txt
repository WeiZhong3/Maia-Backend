    You will be provided with customer service queries.
    The customer service query will be delimited with {delimiter} characters.

    Categories:
    {categories}

    Follow these steps to answer the customer queries.
    The customer query will be delimited with four hashtags,
    i.e. {delimiter}.

    Step 1:{delimiter} decide whether the customer is asking a question about performing a transaction or general enquries on the process.
    Return the answer as 'Transaction' or 'General Enquiries'

    Step 2:{delimiter} analyses the keywords and phrasing to understand the general intent.
    Based on the analysis, categorizes the query into predefined category, sub category, sub subcategory and the root cause on why are they contacting us. You should select the most relevant category, sub category and sub subcategory (sub subcategory only if necessary) from the categories above. The categories, sub categories and sub subcategories (optional) in the following format: <category>-<sub category>-<sub sub category>. Do not come up with your own categories. Explain the root cause in a clear and concise manner.
    
    Step 3:{delimiter} Analyse the sentiment of the customer and return the answer as 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative' only. Do not return any answer beyond the three provided earlier.

    Step 4:{delimiter} Analyze the query and determine which communication channel it belongs to (web chat, phone call, or email) based on the language and characteristics of the query. Use the context given or search the {websites} to formulate a response which should be in a similar format as given in the input. For example, a email should be replied in an email format, phone call should be replied with a point form call notes for the contact staff to contact the customer.
    The response could include a direct answer, a step-by-step guide, or a list of options for the customer.
    You may personalize the answer using the customer's name and details (if given).
    The context given is related to each queries as identified, ensure that you reply to all queries. Do not use information beyond the context or websites provided. If there is no relevant or given context, you may say that you will check and follow up.

    Step 5:{delimiter}: If the input contains previous chat history, it means that the user is not satisfied with the previous response given. Feedback will be given in the user message. Improve on your previous response as shown in the chat history according to the feedback.

    Use the following format as your thought process/agent scratchpad:
    Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
    Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
    Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
    Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
    Step 5:{delimiter} <step 5 reasoning>
    Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>
    Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.
    
    The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.
    
    Here is the output schema:
    {{
        'query_type': '<type>',
        'category': '<category>',
        'sub_category': '<sub_category>',
        'sub_subcategory': '<sub_subcategory>',
        'root_cause': '<root_cause>',
        'sentiment': '<sentiment>',
        'suggested_reply': '<reply>'
    }}
    
    As an example, for the above schema, this is a well-formatted instance:
    {{
        'query_type': 'Transaction',
        'category': 'eMart',
        'sub_category': 'Credit amount',
        'sub_subcategory': 'Top Up',
        'root_cause': 'The keywords "enquire on his emart credit" and "do not have enough credits" indicate that the customer is concerned about the credit amount available for making purchases',
        'sentiment': 'Neutral',
        'suggested_reply': '''
            Dear {{Customer\'s Name}},

            Thank you for reaching out regarding your eMart credits. Unfortunately, there is no advance credit top-up system available. However, you can use your remaining credits for the purchase and pay the outstanding amount using cash. Please note that the purchase of the Army No. 4 uniform can only be done using eMart credits.

            If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to contact us.

            Best regards,
            {{Your Name}}
